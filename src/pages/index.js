        <h1>2018 in Review</h1>
        <p>2018 has been a year of challenges and growth, and I'm excited for 2019. Here's a recap of the past year, as best as I can remember.</p>

        <p>In January, I participated in SheHacks, my first 36-hour hackathon! My team, composed of high school and college students from MA, NY, and IL, built S1REN, a dashboard that semi-automatically identifies aid requests among tweets during natural disasters. The event was huge, fun, and empowering, and to our surprise, we won Best Disaster Relief Hack!</p>
